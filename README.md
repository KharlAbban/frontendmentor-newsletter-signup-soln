- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

Never ignore the basics. ALways recheck your code. I spent almost 2 hours trying to find a problem hidden in plain sightðŸ˜”. In the end, I was able to make it work, thankfully. I saw how simplifying code can lead to better results.

### Continued development

Fade out newsletter form and fade in thank you page.
Coming Soon!
